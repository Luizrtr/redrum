## Getting Started üßëüèæ‚Äçüíª

To get started, ensure you have set up the environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
HOST=localhost:3000
MONGODB=mongodb:your-database
```
Replace your-database with the name of your MongoDB database.

Once the environment variables are configured, proceed to run the development server:
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
After launching the server, open your preferred web browser and navigate to the specified HOST to access the application.
